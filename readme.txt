Stable tag: 0.6

Insert DeviantArt Deviations into your Posts/Sidebar/Pages; Note: This plugin does not currently work.

== Description ==

Note: This plugin does not currently work due to Changes on DA's end, I've not had time to repair the plugin.

Note: Please note that 0.6 will be the last Version which is comparible with 2.2/2.3, Once 2.5 is released, I'll be releasing a new verion of the plugin(1.0) which will take advantage of the new functionality offered by 2.5, and hopefully also fix the long-standing issues with the current plugin branch.

The main features are:

* The ability to have Multiple Widgets predefined, This allows you to quickly switch between the Deviation set your displaying (Or to display multiple Widgets at once)
* In-line Deviations, You can post deviations inside your Blog post by simply including the :thumb: string which is located on all Deviation pages
* Portfolio Pages, You can define an unlimited number of "Portfolio Pages", These pages allow you to show off upto 24 of your Deviations on a single page.

The plugin allows you to either set a RSS feed of the Deviations you want to display, Or allows you to set the Search Criteria when defining a page/widget, This allows anyone to quickly set up the item to display as they please.


== Installation == 

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done this).
2. Upload the ddeviantart folder to your wp-content/plugins directory (not in a sub-folder).
